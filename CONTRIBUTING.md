# How to contribute

The main developer of this project, Patrick Schmalstig (Lovinity), is contributing their own free time to make this repository possible. But free time is a finite asset. I appreciate everyone who is willing to contribute to the project to help develop it and keep it up to date.

- To submit a bug report or feature request, create an issue. Please make sure someone else did not already make an issue for the same thing. Be as detailed and thorough as possible so issues can be re-created / fixed and developers have an understanding how your request would improve this repository.
- To contribute code, please submit a pull request. Please test and thoroughly document your changes before making the request. Pull requests are not guaranteed to be accepted, but we will do our best to explain rejections and, if applicable, what can be done to modify the code to acceptable standards.

## Testing

This library currently does not have a test suite / test coverage. However, it is in the roadmap, and we greatly appreciate anyone willing to contribute to the testing suite.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done and how you believe it would positively contribute to the overall quality of the library / repository. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

  * We use the ["Recommended" Typescript tsconfig base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tsconfig/recommended)
  * We use the [default Prettier code formatting settings](https://prettier.io/) for simplicity.
  * We use the VS Code [Better Comments](https://github.com/aaron-bond/better-comments) extension in our documentation.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
